# Apptentive plugin for Cordova

For integration instructions, please see our [Cordova Integration Documentation](https://www.apptentive.com/docs/cordova/integration/).

This is a forked repository made from v4.0.2 of Apptentive cordova library.
The issue with v4.0.2 is that the IPA submission gives un supporeted platform error. The issue is solved by editing the plist file with the respective keyword parameter changed accordingly.
